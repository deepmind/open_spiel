"""Simple implementation of dynamic routing game to test API.

The dynamic routing game is based on the paper: A mean field route choice game
by R. Salhab, J. Le Ny and R. P. MalhamÃ©, 2018 IEEE CDC.
We consider:
- the following network:
    O --> A --> D
- two vehicles trying to reach D from O.
The two vehicles leave the origin O at the beginning of the game.
At O, they can only go at A. Then at A they can only go at D. At D, both
vehicles cannot do any actions and the game is finished.

Later, to add some complexity, we will add a third vehicle who leaves A to
reach D at the beginning of the game. In this case, at time O, vehicles 0 and 1
go from O to A and vehicle 2 goes from A to D. Then at time 1, vehicles 0 and 1
go from A to D, vehicle 2 cannot do anything and the game is finished.

Later a more complex network can considered, with routing choice at
intersections and probability to stay on a link as a function of the number of
cars on the link. Currently this is not done to test the API.
