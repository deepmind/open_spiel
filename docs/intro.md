## What is OpenSpiel?

OpenSpiel is a collection of environments and algorithms for research in general
reinforcement learning and search/planning in games. OpenSpiel also includes
tools to analyze learning dynamics and other common evaluation metrics. Games
are represented as procedural extensive-form games, with some natural
extensions.

**Open Spiel supports**

*   Single and multi-player games
*   Fully observable (via observations) and imperfect information games (via
    information states and observations)
*   Stochasticity (via explicit chance nodes mostly, even though implicit
    stochasticity is partially supported)
*   n-player normal-form "one-shot" games and (2-player) matrix games
*   Sequential and simultaneous move games
*   Zero-sum, general-sum, and cooperative (identical payoff) games

**Multi-language support**

*   C++11
*   Python 3
*   A subset of the features are available in Swift.

The games and utility functions (e.g. exploitability computation) are written in
C++. These are also available using
[pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) Python (2.7 and 3)
bindings.

The methods names are in `CamelCase` in C++ and `snake_case` in Python (e.g.
`state.ApplyAction` in C++ will be `state.apply_action` in Python). See the
[pybind11](../open_spiel/python/pybind11/pyspiel.cc) definition in
`open_spiel/python/pybind11/pyspel.cc` for the full mapping between names.

For algorithms, many are written in both languages, even if some are only
available from Python.

**Platforms**

OpenSpiel has been tested on Linux (Debian 10 and Ubuntu 19.04). We have not
tested on MacOS or Windows, but since the code uses freely available tools which
are also available on MacOS and Windows, we do not anticipate any (major)
problems compiling and running under those platforms. Patches and instructions
would be much appreciated.
